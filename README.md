A mock Scryfall for custom _Magic the Gathering_ cards that I've designed.

## About

The cards here are custom cards based around a Dungeons & Dragons campaign that my friends and I have been part of for about a year. This campaign has been one of my favorites so far and so I created this faux _Magic the Gathering_ set in its honor. The campaign is titled "Rise to Ragnar√∂k" and is Norse-themed, so the cards reference Nordic pop culture or the Kaldheim set. Playing _Magic_ is one of my group's favorite pasttimes, and I'm a fan of using [Scryfall]("https://scryfall.com/") to look up information about the cards - that's what inspired the design of this site. I want to share the high quality renders of the image files in case anyone wanted to proxy the cards for fun (as I did to play with my group). I thought it would be fun to design and play a draft cube including these cards, all themed around our campaign setting; that's what the decklist is.
